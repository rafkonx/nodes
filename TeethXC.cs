//TeethXC
// This script generates a polycurve representing the outer boundary of a rectangle with "teeth" or sub-rectangles extending outward from two opposite edges.
// The teeth are created along the edges of the rectangle, with specified divisions and spacing.
// The script is designed to work within the Grasshopper environment for Rhino.
